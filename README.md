# Comparing Numerical Solutions for Systems of Equations
A comparison of algorithms for solving linear systems of equations.

I wrote this notebook a few years ago to compare algorithms for solving systems of linear equations. I had just learned how to measure margins of error for floating point operations and wanted to see how it can impact your results. Finding solutions to systems of equations seemed like a good enough problem, so I picked three algorithms that appeared the most in my Google search. 

It's been years since I've written this notebook, but I figured I'd do a write-up for it anyway. The biggest lesson I learned from it was that though some algorithms may give you a higher error, they can also converge on a solution faster than other algorithms.
